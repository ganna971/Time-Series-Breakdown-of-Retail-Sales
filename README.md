# Task 7: Time Series Breakdown of Retail Sales  
*Part of Elevvo Internship Projects*  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description  
This project analyzes the **Walmart Sales Forecasting Dataset (Kaggle)** to uncover **time series trends and patterns** in retail sales. The dataset includes weekly sales, store information, and external features like holidays, fuel prices, and unemployment rates.  

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Files  
- **train.csv** â†’ Weekly sales by store and department  
- **test.csv** â†’ Test set for forecasting (not used in this analysis)  
- **features.csv** â†’ Additional variables (holiday flag, fuel, CPI, etc.)  
- **stores.csv** â†’ Metadata about store type and size  

## ðŸ”§ Steps Performed  
1. **Data Cleaning & Merging**  
   - Combined `train`, `features`, and `stores` into one dataset  
   - Converted dates and extracted `Year` and `Month`  

2. **Time Series Analysis**  
   - Overall **monthly sales trends**  
   - **3-month moving average** smoothing  
   - **Seasonal patterns** (monthly averages across years)  

3. **Breakdown Analysis**  
   - Sales trends by **Store Type (A, B, C)**  
   - Sales trends for **Top 5 Product Departments**  

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights  
- **Sales seasonality:** Peak sales during Novemberâ€“December due to holidays  
- **Store Type A dominance:** Largest stores (Type A) consistently outperform Types B & C
